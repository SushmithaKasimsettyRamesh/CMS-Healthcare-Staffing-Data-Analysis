Executive Summary
This report presents a data-driven analysis of the CMS Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) Q2 2024 data to help Clipboard Health identify strategic opportunities for expanding contractor staffing services. The analysis explores nationwide trends and pinpoints high-priority facilities where staffing solutions can generate measurable impact.

Key Findings Overview
28.9M+ contractor hours analyzed across all U.S. nursing facilities

341 high-dependency facilities identified as immediate sales targets

$7.15B in penalties ‚Äî opportunity to position staffing as a cost-avoidance strategy

Major weekend staffing gaps across RN, LPN, and CNA roles

Recommendation 1: Target High Contractor Dependency Facilities
üéØ Immediate Action Required

Finding:
341 facilities have an average contractor dependency ratio of 43.8%, which is 6√ó the national average.

Recommendation 2: Address Critical Weekend Staffing Gaps
‚è∞ Weekend Opportunity

Finding:
Weekend staffing levels are significantly lower than weekdays:

RN: 60.4% of weekday staffing

LPN: 37.0%

CNA: 36.9%

Business Impact:
High unmet need for weekend coverage represents a strong growth area.

Implementation Steps:

Create weekend-specific contractor offerings

Launch a ‚ÄúWeekend Staffing Solutions‚Äù campaign

Target facilities with lowest weekend contractor usage

Recommendation 3: Target High-Penalty, Low-Contractor Facilities
üí∞ ROI Opportunity

Finding:
1,043 facilities face $7.15B in penalties but use contractors at just 0.22% on average.

Top States (by facility count):

Texas: 120

California: 79

Washington: 62

Mississippi: 45

Iowa: 45

Business Impact:
Penalties provide a compelling ROI narrative ‚Äî contractor staffing can reduce regulatory risk.

Recommendation 4: Focus on High-Census, Low-Contractor Facilities
üìä Capacity Mismatch Targets

Finding:
Facilities with large resident populations but minimal contractor use.

Examples:

NY Facility: 150 residents, 4.11% contractor usage (Imbalance Score: 128.42)

TX Facility: 120 residents, 3.54% usage (Score: 103.35)

MI Facility: 110 residents, 20.51% usage
